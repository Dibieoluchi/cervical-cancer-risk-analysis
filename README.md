The dataset was obtained from UCI Repository
Using the information from my investigation, establish a comprehensive plan to prevent, screen for, treat, and eradicate cervical cancer as a public health concern within a generation. This file contains a list of risk factors for cervical cancer leading to a biopsy examination. 


THE DISEASE: Cervical cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the cervix. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women. In 2018, an estimated 570 000 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer worldwide and about 311 000 women died from the disease.


2. Natural history, including development from latent to declared disease:Cervical cancer usually develops slowly over time



3. Recognizable latent or early symptomatic stage:Early-stage cervical cancer generally produces no signs or symptoms.Signs and symptoms of more-advanced cervical cancer include:Vaginal bleeding after intercourse, between periods or after menopause,Watery and bloody vaginal discharge that may be heavy and have a foul odor,Pelvic pain or pain during intercourse


Analysis highlighting the relationship between the following risk factors and cervical cancer

Age: According to our data, the average age of women who have cervical cancer is 33, while the average age of those who do not have it is 26, supporting our assertion that cervical cancer is more common in women between the ages of 30 and 40.

 HPV:The fact that a sizable portion of those with hpv disease also tested negative for cervical cancer serves as evidence that hpv is not a malignancy and that having hpv does not guarantee developing cervical cancer. We made a graphic to display the distribution of hpv-positive patients in our dataset and how this condition affects the status of females with cervical cancer. Although 99% of cases of cervical cancer are thought to be caused by high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV), an extremely common sexually transmitted virus, most HPV infections are not caused by this virus, and most HPV infections heal on their own and show no symptoms. The only thing that might cause women to develop cervical cancer is a persistent infection, which is referred to as the pre cancer stage (early stage). The Hpv vaccine can be used to cure hpv and prevent cervical cancer.
 
 Number of active sexual partners: Our dataset revealed that women who reported having more than one active partner are most at risk of developing cervical cancer.
 
 STD :We can see from our dataset that the majority of the females from which the data samples were drawn had never had a sexually transmitted disease. We also see that, despite the majority not having ever had an STD case, roughly 2% of them tested positive for cervical cancer. Condylomatosis, cervical condylomatosis, vaginal condylomatosis, vulvo-perineal condylomatosis, syphilis, pelvic inflammatory disease, genital herpes, molluscum contagiosum, AIDS, HIV, and Hepatitis B, which are highlighted in this dataset, are not factors that cause cervical cancer. Only about 1% of females in our data tested positive for both cervical and one other STD
 
 smoking status of a patient: Based on our data, it is clear that there is no connection between a patient's smoking behavior and her cervical cancer. Smoking status is not a factor in determining cervical cancer risk.
 
 Hormonal Contraceptives: According to our analysis, there is no link between the use of hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control tablets and intrauterine devices) and cervical cancer. Our Dataset's highlighted birth control method does not increase the risk of cervical cancer
 
 
 THE SCREENING TEST
 
 
There are suitable tests or exams out there that are secure, dependable, easy, affordable, and simple, and the test is accepted by the general public: AC In line with our analysis Cervical cancer cases in Hiselmann tests were at their highest. It may seem surprising that colposcopy is accurate in detecting all benign lesions and early atypical transformations, but it enables the precise diagnosis among women with abnormal pap smear results. The diagnosis,Hinselmann, is a test method for cervical cancer by examining the cells on an instrument called a colposcope.

DIAGNOSTIC TEST AND TREATMENT


a recognized kind of treatment for patients with a diagnosed illness, The stage of the cancer, any underlying health issues, and your preferences all play a role in how you will be treated for cervical cancer. Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, or a combination of the three may be employed.
